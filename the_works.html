						<h4><i>(From a friend. Some arrangements of words that mean a lot to me)</i></h4>
						
						<h3>You are a student but also a person.</h3>
						
						<p>Physics will continue to be there. Quantum gravity won't be solved anytime soon. Chill out and treat yourself with compassion. Eat. Sleep. Drink water. Be a houseplant and gauge your limits properly so you can work effectively and keep your sanity to some extent.</p>

						<p>When people give you advice, ALWAYS take it with a grain of salt. They may be more experienced, but ultimately you need to know yourself well enough to understand what you can and cannot handle and what works best for you. People tend to project their own experiences. Listen to other people, but don't do it blindly. There's a line between being confident in your abilities and being foolishly arrogant. Know your strengths and weaknesses and if you're certain about taking a certain courseload or pursuing a particular activity, don't let people dissuade you and don't let your fears or insecurities hold you back from jumping into something you're ready for.</p>

						<p>Just because you're capable of doing something doesn't mean you should. If your workload is compromising your ability to do basic things like eat or sleep, if you're getting sick from stress etc or abusing any substance ‚Äî then it's time to sit down and reevaluate your priorities and make the necessary adjustments. Issues like physical illness and substance abuse are difficult to bounce back from. Burn out is also extremely difficult to bounce back from.</p>	
						
						<p>It's difficult but drown out the noise and stop giving a fuck about what most people say and think. There's people here who are exceedingly immature, people who are bigoted, people who will get on your ass about practically anything‚Äî the works. If you're part of a minority group, you'll feel it eventually if you haven't already. There'll be that one openly racist person in a class and you won't know whether to be angry or just laugh at how absurd it is. That's just how it is no matter where you go. Fuck it and focus on yourself. Don't be a pretentious asshole.</p>


						<p>Again, don't be a pretentious asshole. Everyone here is here to learn and sometimes it takes people more time to understand something. Sometimes what's easy for you is hard for others and vice versa. People learn in different ways and on different timelines. Don't beat yourself up over a bad test score or not being able to immediately understand every concept you learn in class. You'll learn it eventually. Sometimes that might be after the semester is over, but you'll get there. Don't be a demeaning prick to anyone else. This isn't a competition and not everyone comes from the same background.</p>


						<p>Coping with substances is understandable imo. I get it. A good rule of thumb is to establish boundaries when you are in a stable mental state. Make it clear cut what substances are absolutely off limits for you and what dosage you will not be going over. Set limits for how often you take something. If you do anything with drugs, you cannot act on impulse and need to have some margin of discipline and caution. Addiction isn't a joke. Overdose isn't a joke. Give a fuck about yourself and your safety because even if you don't care about yourself I promise that there is at least one person who does and you can find solace in that. I won't tell you not to use substances. That'd be hypocritical of me lol. Just know what you're getting yourself into and don't be a dumbass.</p>
			 
						<p>Something to consider when picking classes is what course structure and grading scheme will allow you to perform your best. For instance, I have bad anxiety and ADHD. Courses with take home exams or a points based grading system work significantly better for me. Not taking a hefty courseload so I can focus more on each class and have the flexibility to account for bad mental health or sick days and any hyperfixations on research or external material I may have through the semester works really well for me. I prefer having fewer commitments so I can add more to my plate and drop things as I please. That might also be how you work, or maybe you prefer having seven classes and a shit ton of extracurriculars scheduled out . I don't really care what you do, just make it work for you.</p>

						<p>Gauge yourself solely by your personal goals and metric of where you wanna be. Comparing yourself to others is a waste of time. Be better than that.</p>

						<p>Don't be afraid to push yourself and take on challenges. This bit is controversial but... if you have AP credits, claim them and move on unless you have a very very good reason not to. Let yourself explore things and find joy in pursuing these subjects. It's fun I promise.</p>

						<p>You'll fuck up a lot. Learn from it and move on. Sometimes circumstances can't be overcome. Sometimes you know you're making a dumb decision but need to see it out for yourself because you need to experience why everyone is telling you not to do that thing. Fair enough. Try not to be an idiot and repeat your mistakes.</p>
						
						<h3>Imposter Syndrome, Overconfidence and Ambition</h3>
						
						<p>The way I see it, the main tropes physics and math people fall into are those of impostor syndrome or overconfidence.</p>

						<p>The best way to begin is by recognizing that it's not that deep. Mellow out. Don't overthink. If you come from a background where you were a top student or have been exposed to a ton of higher-level physics and math, that's great! But do not start thinking that this somehow makes you automatically 'better' than your peers. You can be brilliant and still insufferable. Be realistic about what you know and where your capabilities lie; confidence is amazing to have, but it's really easy to become arrogant, pretentious, and foolish. The more you learn, the more you realize you know very little. </p>

						<p>On another note, impostor syndrome is very prevalent. You will always be around people who know more than you or have done more. Thing is, half the time the people who're going around and flaunting their knowledge and opportunities aren't at the level they think they are. It takes maturity to be able to step back and go at a pace that works for you, even if that means you're a class or two "behind". You aren't stupid for taking longer to understand a concept. You need to be comfortable with admitting when you don't know something and seeking out knowledge and learning new skills on your own. Give yourself enough credit and don't underestimate your abilities. </p>

						<p>TLDR: Ambition is good but don't be a pretentious fool. </p>
						
						<p>Understand that you barely know anything and that's ok.</p>
						
						<p>It literally doesn't matter where you are relative to your peers; just do what works for you. This is physics not an ego war.</p>
